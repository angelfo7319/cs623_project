Java project that connects to PostgreSQL, and modified existing Product, Depot, and Stock tables within 6 transactions. Each transaction uses Java code to connect, modify, and commit these changes to the database.
The changes are not visible through the Java code, but instead are combined with a video representation of the transactions and the PostgreSQL database on my local machine.
